# Maze-Game
This simple maze game was part of project i did for homework at my university. As subject was Algorithms and data structures no fancy formating of the code was allowed. So the whole project was not done in OOP style as focus was most on the performance. Game works by asking a user to input a maze if form of a graph of desired size, with coordinates of enterance and exit and all the edges making ways through the maze. Based on the usual size of the problem and it's description the algorithm i chose is Dijstras algorithm. Other algorithms such as Floyd Warshall algorithm, which were much easier to implement, were giving sligthly worse performances (although i may upload that version as well for learning purposes). The representation of graph which i was given as part of my homework were linear adjacency list, a list of all the edges in that graph, and another list containing the beggining index of specified vertex in ajacency list. Whole making of this project was extremely fun, although exhausting as materials in our book were pretty scarce for given topic and i wanted to try to do it from scratch.
